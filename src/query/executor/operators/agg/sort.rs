// Sort-based Aggregation Operator
//
// This operator implements aggregation by sorting rows by the group-by keys
// and then computing aggregates for each group sequentially
//
// Note: This is a placeholder file for future implementation. The sort-based
// approach can be more memory-efficient for large datasets that don't fit in memory.
