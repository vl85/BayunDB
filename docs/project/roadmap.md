# BayunDB Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development steps for BayunDB, organized by completion status and priority.

## Completed Features

1. **Query Planning and Execution**
   - SQL parser and abstract syntax tree
   - Logical query planning
   - Physical query planning
   - Basic execution operators (Scan, Filter, Project)
   - Basic predicate evaluation
   - Parser support for JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT)
   - Integration tests for JOIN queries
   - Join execution operators (Hash Join, Nested Loop Join)
   - Parser support for GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
   - Parser support for aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
   - Logical planning for aggregation

2. **Performance Benchmarking**
   - Buffer pool performance benchmarks
   - B+Tree index benchmarks
   - Query parser benchmarks with JSON output format
   - Automated benchmark report generation
   - WAL and recovery performance benchmarks

3. **Transaction Management (Partial)**
   - WAL (Write-Ahead Log) implementation
   - Transaction manager
   - Basic recovery implementation

4. **Command Line Interface (CLI)**
   - Interactive SQL shell with command history
   - Direct query execution for scripting
   - Database information display
   - Database creation
   - Formatted table output for query results

## Current Development Focus

1. **Query Execution Enhancements**
   - [Add aggregation operators (GROUP BY, COUNT, SUM, etc.)](implementation-plans/aggregation-operators.md)
   - Add ORDER BY implementation
   - Add LIMIT/OFFSET support
   - Add subquery support

2. **ACID Transaction Support Completion**
   - Full ARIES-style recovery with transaction rollback
   - Isolation level support (READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, SERIALIZABLE)
   - Deadlock detection and prevention

3. **B+Tree Index Enhancements**
   - Support for concurrency in B+Tree operations
   - Support for compound keys
   - Index scan operators in query execution
   - Index usage in query planning

4. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
   - Improve error reporting and recovery
   - Add debugging tools
   - Implement more robust exception handling

5. **Schema and Catalog Management**
   - Build metadata storage system
   - Implement schema versioning
   - Add constraint management
   - Implement DDL operations (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE)

## In Progress Features

1. **Aggregation Operators**
   - ✅ Parser support for GROUP BY, HAVING, and aggregate functions
   - ✅ Logical planning for aggregation
   - ⏳ Physical operators for aggregation (HashAggregate)
   - ⏳ Execution engine implementation
   - See [aggregation-operators implementation plan](implementation-plans/aggregation-operators.md) for details

2. **Schema Management**
   - Parser support for CREATE TABLE statements
   - Schema validation and type checking
   - Table metadata management
   - Catalog management
   - Support for ALTER TABLE operations

## Medium-term Goals

1. **Server Connection Handling**
   - Network protocol implementation
   - Client connection management
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Client/server architecture
   - Connection pooling

2. **Advanced SQL Functionality**
   - Support complex joins (outer joins, semi-joins)
   - Implement window functions
   - Prepared statements
   - Views
   - Foreign key constraints
   - Triggers
   - Stored procedures

3. **Enhanced Testing Framework**
   - Replace string-based predicate representation with proper AST evaluation
   - Create a mock data generator for testing with realistic datasets
   - Support for predefined test tables with known contents
   - Framework for verifying query results match expected outputs
   - Golden test files for query result verification

## Long-term Vision

1. **Distributed Database Support**
   - Distributed query execution
   - Data partitioning
   - Replication
   - Consensus protocol implementation
   - Distributed transactions

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Cost-based optimizer
   - Statistics collection and utilization
   - Query caching
   - Just-in-time compilation of queries
   - Advanced indexing techniques
