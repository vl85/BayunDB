# SQLite Comparison Benchmarking Plan

This document outlines the approach for benchmarking BayunDB against SQLite to ensure feature parity and comparable performance for the most commonly used database operations.

## Benchmarking Goals

1. **Feature Validation**: Confirm that BayunDB correctly implements SQLite's most common features
2. **Performance Comparison**: Measure performance metrics against SQLite for key operations
3. **Embedded Usage**: Compare BayunDB and SQLite in embedded application scenarios
4. **Continuous Tracking**: Establish a system for tracking performance over time

## Benchmark Categories

### 1. Core SQL Operations

#### SELECT Performance
- Simple SELECT with WHERE clause (various table sizes)
- SELECT with JOINs (2-table, 3-table, 4-table joins)
- SELECT with GROUP BY and aggregations
- SELECT with ORDER BY and pagination (LIMIT/OFFSET)
- Full table scans vs. index usage

#### Data Manipulation
- INSERT performance (single row, batch inserts)
- UPDATE performance (with/without indexes)
- DELETE performance (with/without indexes)

#### Data Definition
- CREATE TABLE performance
- ALTER TABLE operations
- CREATE/DROP INDEX performance

#### Transaction Performance
- Transaction throughput (BEGIN, INSERT, COMMIT)
- Transaction rollback performance
- Transaction concurrency under load

### 2. Storage Engine Performance

- Single-page read/write operations
- Buffer pool hit rates
- B+Tree operations (insert, search, update, delete)
- Sequential vs. random access patterns

### 3. Embedded Usage Scenarios

- Library initialization time
- Memory footprint during operation
- API call overhead
- Cold start query execution time
- Data serialization/deserialization performance

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Benchmark Framework

We will create a modular benchmark framework with:

- Common test dataset generation
- JSON output for result analysis
- Markdown report generation
- Automated SQLite vs. BayunDB comparison

```rust
// Example structure for benchmark results
struct BenchmarkResult {
    operation: String,
    database: String,    // "SQLite" or "BayunDB"
    rows_affected: usize,
    execution_time_ms: f64,
    memory_usage_kb: usize,
    // Additional metrics
}
```

### 2. Core Benchmarks

For each core SQL operation identified, create:

1. **Identical Schema**: Ensure table definitions match between SQLite and BayunDB
2. **Test Datasets**: Generate consistent test data at various scales
3. **Benchmark Cases**: Well-defined test cases with specific queries
4. **Metrics Collection**: Consistent metrics for each operation

### 3. Reporting

The benchmark suite will generate:

- Raw JSON data with all metrics
- Markdown comparison tables
- Performance comparison charts (can be generated with a simple script)
- Feature support validation summaries

Example report format:
```markdown
## SELECT Query Performance

| Query Type | SQLite (ms) | BayunDB (ms) | Ratio | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------------|-------|--------|
| Simple SELECT | 10.5 | 12.3 | 1.17x | ✅ |
| JOIN (2 tables) | 22.8 | 29.1 | 1.28x | ✅ |
| Complex aggregate | 45.6 | 60.2 | 1.32x | ⚠️ |
```

## Initial Benchmark Implementation

The first phase will focus on implementing benchmarks for:

1. **Simple CRUD operations**
   - Single row operations
   - Batch operations
   - Indexed vs. non-indexed operations

2. **Basic query patterns**
   - Simple filtering
   - Basic joins
   - Simple aggregations

3. **Embedded API usage**
   - Database creation
   - Simple query execution
   - Database connection management

## Future Benchmark Extensions

After the initial implementation, we'll expand the benchmarks to cover:

1. **Complex query scenarios**
   - Multi-table joins
   - Complex aggregations
   - Window functions

2. **Concurrency tests**
   - Multiple concurrent readers
   - Reader/writer contention
   - Transaction isolation levels

3. **Stress testing**
   - High volume insert/update/delete
   - Mixed workload performance
   - Recovery after crash

## Next Steps

1. Implement the benchmark framework with JSON output capability
2. Create common dataset generators for different test scales
3. Implement the first set of core benchmarks
4. Establish baseline performance against SQLite
5. Generate initial comparison reports
6. Identify performance bottlenecks for optimization
