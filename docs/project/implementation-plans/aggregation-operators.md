# Implementation Plan: Aggregation Operators

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding aggregate operator support to BayunDB, including GROUP BY, COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX functionality.

## 1. Research and Design (2 weeks) ✅

### Parser and AST Enhancements ✅
- Add lexer/parser support for GROUP BY clauses
- Add lexer/parser support for aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
- Design AST nodes for aggregate functions and GROUP BY clauses
- Update parser tests to include aggregate queries

### Query Planning ✅
- Design logical representation of aggregation in query plans
- Design physical operators for aggregation (HashAggregate, SortAggregate)
- Update query planner to recognize and plan for aggregate operations

### Execution Engine ✅
- Design data structures for managing grouped data
- Consider memory management for large group sets

## 2. Implementation (4 weeks) ✅

### Phase 1: Parser Implementation (1 week) ✅
- Extend lexer to recognize aggregate function keywords
- Implement parser rules for GROUP BY clauses
- Implement parser rules for HAVING clauses
- Build AST nodes for aggregate expressions
- Add validation for aggregate expressions in SELECT lists

### Phase 2: Logical Planning (1 week) ✅
- Create logical plan nodes for aggregation
- Implement logical planning logic to handle GROUP BY
- Implement logical planning for HAVING clauses
- Add validation for group keys and aggregate functions
- Handle column references in GROUP BY (validate non-aggregated columns)

### Phase 3: Physical Planning (1 week) ✅
- Implement HashAggregate operator
  - Group management with hash tables
  - Running aggregate calculation
- Implement cost estimation for planner decisions
- Provide framework for choosing between hash and sort-based aggregation

### Phase 4: Execution Engine (1 week) ✅
- Implement aggregate function calculations:
  - COUNT: row counting
  - SUM: numeric addition
  - AVG: sum and count tracking
  - MIN/MAX: value comparison
- Add null handling for aggregate inputs
- Implement grouping logic with hash tables
- Implement streaming sort-based aggregation as a memory-efficient alternative
- Implement HAVING predicate evaluation

## 3. Testing (2 weeks) ✅

### Unit Testing ✅
- Test individual aggregate function calculations
- Test grouping logic with various data types
- Test edge cases (empty groups, NULL values)

### Integration Testing ✅
- Add test cases for each aggregate function
- Test GROUP BY with multiple columns
- Test HAVING clauses
- Test aggregate queries with JOINs
- Test queries with both WHERE and GROUP BY

### Performance Testing ✅
- Benchmark memory usage for different group sizes
- Measure execution time for various aggregation scenarios
- Test with large datasets to identify bottlenecks

## 4. Documentation and Examples (1 week) ✅

- Update SQL syntax documentation
- Add examples of aggregate queries
- Document limitations and edge cases
- Create tutorial for using aggregation in queries
- Update CLI examples to showcase aggregation capabilities

## 5. Code Review and Refinement (1 week) ✅

- Address performance bottlenecks
- Refine memory management
- Ensure proper error handling
- Validate against SQL standards

## Timeline

- Total estimated time: 10 weeks
- Key milestones:
  - Week 2: Complete parser implementation with tests ✅
  - Week 4: Logical and physical planning complete ✅
  - Week 6: Execution engine implementation complete ✅
  - Week 8: Integration tests passing ✅
  - Week 10: Documentation complete and feature ready for release ✅

## Current Status

- ✅ Parser implementation is complete with tests
- ✅ AST structure has been enhanced to support GROUP BY, HAVING, and aggregate functions
- ✅ Logical planner has been updated to create Aggregate nodes
- ✅ Physical planner has been updated to handle aggregation
- ✅ Cost model enhanced to account for group-by complexity
- ✅ HashAggregateOperator has been fully implemented with all aggregation functions
- ✅ SortAggregateOperator has been implemented for memory-efficient processing
- ✅ Integration tests for parser features are passing
- ✅ Full execution engine implementation for aggregation is complete
- ✅ End-to-end query execution for aggregation is complete with tests
- ✅ CLI integration for aggregation has been tested and fixed
- ✅ Performance testing for aggregation operations is complete

## Next Steps

✅ All Aggregation Operator features have been implemented, tested, and documented.

## Dependencies

- Existing query execution framework
- Expression evaluation system
- Memory management infrastructure
- Test framework for query validation

## Sample Queries

This implementation enables queries like:

```sql
-- Basic aggregation
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*), SUM(salary), AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;

-- Aggregation with filtering
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*), AVG(salary)
FROM employees
WHERE status = 'active'
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;

-- Multi-column grouping
SELECT department_id, job_title, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id, job_title;

-- Aggregation with joins
SELECT d.name, COUNT(e.id), AVG(e.salary)
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
GROUP BY d.name;
```

## Implementation Considerations

### Memory Management
- For large datasets, investigate partial aggregation to reduce memory pressure
- Consider spilling to disk for groups that don't fit in memory

### Optimizations
- Push down filters before aggregation when possible
- Explore parallel aggregation for performance on multi-core systems
- Implement streaming aggregation for cases that don't require storing all groups
