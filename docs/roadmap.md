# BayunDB Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned next steps for BayunDB development.

## Completed

1. **Query Planning and Execution Implementation** âœ…
   - SQL parser and abstract syntax tree
   - Logical query planning
   - Physical query planning
   - Basic execution operators (Scan, Filter, Project)
   - Basic predicate evaluation

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Query Execution Enhancements**
   - Implement join operators (Hash Join, Nested Loop Join)
   - Add aggregation operators (GROUP BY, COUNT, SUM, AVG)
   - Support sorting and ORDER BY
   - Implement query optimization rules with cost-based decisions

2. **ACID Transaction Support**
   - Implement transaction manager
   - Add isolation level support (Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable)
   - Build concurrency control mechanism (MVCC or lock-based)

3. **B+Tree Enhancements**
   - Implement range scans
   - Add deletion support
   - Optimize for bulk operations
   - Support index scan execution operators

4. **Query Catalog Integration**
   - Connect query planner with system catalog
   - Add table statistics for optimization
   - Implement schema-aware planning

5. **Server Connection Handling**
   - Create network connection handler
   - Implement client protocol
   - Add connection pooling

## Medium-Term Goals

6. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
   - Improve error reporting and recovery
   - Add debugging tools
   - Implement more robust exception handling

7. **Schema and Catalog Management**
   - Build metadata storage system
   - Implement schema versioning
   - Add constraint management

8. **WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)**
   - Implement log manager
   - Add crash recovery
   - Optimize logging performance

## Long-Term Goals

9. **Advanced SQL Functionality**
   - Support complex joins (outer joins, semi-joins)
   - Implement window functions
   - Add subquery support
   - Advanced indexing and hints

10. **Distributed Query Processing**
    - Implement distributed execution plans
    - Add partition support
    - Support distributed transactions

11. **Documentation and Examples**
    - Create comprehensive developer documentation
    - Build example applications
    - Add interactive tutorial
