   - Basic execution operators (Scan, Filter, Project)
   - Basic predicate evaluation
   - Parser support for JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT) ✅
   - Integration tests for JOIN queries ✅
   - Join execution operators (Hash Join, Nested Loop Join) ✅

2. **Performance Benchmarking** ✅
   - Buffer pool performance benchmarks
   - B+Tree index benchmarks
   - Query parser benchmarks with JSON output format
   - Automated benchmark report generation

## Immediate Next Steps

   - Implement window functions
   - Add subquery support
   - Advanced indexing and hints

9. **Distributed Query Processing**

## Enhanced Testing Framework

- [ ] **Improved Expression Handling**
  - Replace string-based predicate representation with proper AST evaluation
  - Support complex expressions in filter, join conditions, etc.

- [ ] **Test Data Infrastructure**
  - Create a mock data generator for testing with realistic datasets
  - Support for predefined test tables with known contents
  - Mock catalog implementation for table metadata

- [ ] **End-to-End Query Verification**
  - Framework for verifying query results match expected outputs
  - Golden test files for query result verification
  - Performance benchmarking infrastructure
